## Exercise 2.2-4

*How can you modify any sorting algorithm to have a good best-case running time?*


- In case of Quick Sort Algorithm, it obviously makes sense to get a better pivot. In the code from `C2-Getting-Started/sort_c' for quick sort algorithm, I've used the element corresponding to first index as pivot but apparently there are better ways.

- In Insertion Sort, using binary search to find insertion index in the sorted part of the array could improve the sorting.
