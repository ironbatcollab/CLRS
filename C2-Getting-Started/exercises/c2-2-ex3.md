## Exercise 2.2-3

**Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-4). How many elements of the input array need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case?**

```
// Linear Search for A[1:n]

result = NIL
for i=1 to n:
    if A[i] equals x:
        result = i
        break
return result
```

- Possible cases:
    - Find an element with value x at index i in A[1:n]
        - Requires i iterations each
        - So 1,2,3....n
    - Not find required element at all
        - However, the loop invariant is set-up to find this automatically at the end of n(th) loop iteration

- On average: (n+1)/2 elements need to be checked
- In worst case: n elements
- In best case: 1 element
