## Exercise 2.1-4

Consider the searching problem:  
Input: A sequence of n numbers a-1 to a-n stored in an array A[1:n] and value x.  
Output: An index i such that x equals A[i] or the special value NIL if x does not appear in A.***  

***Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the array from beginning to end, looking for x . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfill the three necessary properties.***

Code: (1-index)
```
temp = NIL
for i=1 to n:
    if A[i] equals x:
        temp = i
        break // Exit loop once value is found
return temp
```

**Loop Invariant**: In every iteration `temp` holds the either index value of first occurence of x or a NIL value.  

Initialization: Before the loop, index cannot be found, so it has to be NIL    
Maintenence: Since the value of `temp` changes only when corresponding array value equals x, the loop invariant will hold true.  
Termination: Loop terminates either when all indices are checked or when it breaks from the loop after getting required answer (in which case Loop Invariant is still valid)
