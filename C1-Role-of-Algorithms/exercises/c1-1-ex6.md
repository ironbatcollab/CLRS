## Exercise 1.1-6

**Describe a real-world problem in which sometimes the entire input is available before you need to solve the problem, but other times the input is not entirely available in advance and arrives over time.**

- Missile navigation system
    - On a dry, sunny day with no winds: The external factors such as air resistance can be assumed constant.
    - On windy day or during storms: Winds may keep varying, rains might have an effect (?) etc. In which case, input has to be gathered dynamically using sensors.

- Traffic management
