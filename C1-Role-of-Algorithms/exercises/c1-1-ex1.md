## Exercise 1.1-1

**Describe your own real-world example that requires sorting. Describe one that requires finding the shortest distance between two points.**

- Say I am trying to visualize the gains of my stocks in various companies. It would make sense to use a bar graph with increasing trend. Hence, sorting!

- Computing "Shortest distance between two points" is critical in Navigation. That's obvious! I'd use the variation of this, to find minimum ticket cost if I were to travel from town A to town B during festive season. Instead of using distances, I'd use the cost of ticket.
