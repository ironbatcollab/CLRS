## Exercise 1.1-3

**Select a data structure that you have seen, and discuss its strengths and limitations.**

```Singly Linked Lists```
- Strengths:
    - Easy to add next element dynamically.
    - Linear and visualizeable
    - Deleting a single element is less complex than array

- Limitations:
    - Accessing nth element is hard.
    - Searching is hard, especially if there's no trend and size of linked list is unknown.
    - Not accessible in continuous manner.
